# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs. See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for workflow details.

## Project Overview

Family Panel is a new project currently in the early setup phase. The codebase uses **Beads (bd)** for issue tracking instead of traditional markdown-based task management.

**Parallel Agent Support**: This project supports running multiple AI agents in parallel on different issues using separate repository clones. See [PARALLEL_AGENTS.md](./PARALLEL_AGENTS.md) for details.

## Development Status
